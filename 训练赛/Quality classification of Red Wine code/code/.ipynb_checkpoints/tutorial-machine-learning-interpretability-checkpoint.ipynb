    "Machine Learning Interpretability of is a hot and crucial subject : machine learning algorithms are everywhere, becoming more and more ubiquitous, complex and efficient, and sometimes treated like __black-boxes__. They have already, and will have in the future, more and more impact on our society and our everyday's life. As (future) Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineers, even if we clearly don't need interpretability all the time, I think we have a social and professional ethical duty trying to design models as **fair, accountable and transparent** as possible. Meaning : unbiasedness/non-discriminative, giving reliable results and being able to be queried to validate predictive decisions.The recent European GDRP (General Data Protection Regulation) resolution testifies to a citizen \"right to explanation\" of algorithmic decisions that \"significantly\" affect any individual. Further more, interpreting our machine learning processes could give us valuable insights for :\n",

    "- to have a practical grasp on some of the main frameworks actually available for machine learning interpretability like __ELI5, LIME, SKATER, or SHAP__ (and also PDPbox and FairML). \n",

In that case, regularization techniques like L1-regularization/LASSO can be usefull to reduce the feature space and improving the interpretability of the model. For non-parametric models, fortunately, many of them like XGBoost give an access to interpretation methods like feature importance for helping us to understand the inner evaluation of the model for making his predictions."

The skater feature importance implementation is based on an information theoretic criteria, measuring the entropy in the change of predictions, given a perturbation of a given feature. The intuition is that the more a model's decision criteria depend on a feature, the more we'll see predictions change as a function of perturbing a feature. The default method used is `prediction-variance` which is the mean absolute value of changes in predictions, given perturbations in the data."

    "Skater can leverage LIME to explain model predictions. Typically, its `LimeTabularExplainer` class helps in explaining predictions on tabular (i.e. matrix) data. For numerical features, it perturbs them by sampling from a Normal(0,1) and doing the inverse operation of mean-centering and scaling, according to the means and stds in the training data. For categorical features, it perturbs by sampling according to the training distribution, and making a binary feature that is 1 when the value is the same as the instance being explained. The `explain_instance()` function generates explanations for a prediction. First, we generate neighborhood data by randomly perturbing features from the instance. We then learn locally weighted linear (surrogate) models on this neighborhood data to explain each of the classes in an interpretable way."

    "__[FairML](https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml)__ is a new Python library that audits black-box predictive models. The basic idea behind FairML (and many other attempts to audit or interpret model behavior) is to measure a model’s dependence on its inputs by changing them. If a small change to an input feature dramatically changes the output, the model is sensitive to the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the input attributes are correlated?\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick used here to counter this multicollinearity is **orthogonal projection**. FairML orthogonally projects the input to measure the dependence of the predictive model on each attribute. Orthogonal projection of vectors is important because it allows us to completely remove the linear dependence between attributes. If two vectors are orthogonal to one another, then no linear transformation of one vector can produce the other. This intuition underlies the feature dependence measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of FairML is that it can audit any classifier or regressor. FairML only requires that it has a `predict function`.\n",

Anyway, the current preoccupation for this subject alone shows that ML has reached a sufficient maturity so that we, human beings, could now learn very interesting insights from the internal behavior of the very same ML/AI models we produce.
